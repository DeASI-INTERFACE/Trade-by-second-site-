## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Public disclosure before a coordinated fix puts users at risk and will not be acknowledged or rewarded.

### How to Report

Report security vulnerabilities privately via:
- **GitHub Private Security Advisory** (preferred): [Security Advisories](https://github.com/De-ASI-INTERFACE/Trade-by-second-site-/security/advisories/new)
- **Direct message on X/Twitter**: [@De-ASI-INTERFACE](https://x.com)

Include in your report:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations if known

---

## Coordinated Disclosure Policy

- You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours**
- We will investigate and communicate a timeline for a fix
- **No public disclosure** until a patch is released and deployed
- We reserve the right to determine the severity and fix timeline
- Responsible disclosures will be credited in the release notes (if desired)

## Security Practices in This Codebase

- All secrets are loaded from environment variables — never hardcoded
- All commits are GPG-signed
- Dependencies are pinned to verified versions
- No unvetted GitHub Actions or third-party apps are authorized
